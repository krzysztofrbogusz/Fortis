# Fortis

A featural, autosegmental phonology engine for diachronic and synchronic use.

## What it is

Fortis takes a lexicon and an ordered set of phonological rules and derives,
word by word, every intermediate form from input to surface — recording
exactly which rule fired, what it changed, and why. Words aren't strings that
get pattern-matched character by character; they're sequences of **feature
bundles**, so a rule like "voiceless stops become voiced between vowels" is
written once, over features, and fires on every segment it describes,
regardless of how any particular inventory happens to spell it.

Suprasegmental features (tone, stress) live on **autosegmental tiers**,
linked to their anchor segment by identity rather than baked into it — so a
tone can spread across several vowels, dock onto one after floating free, or
survive the deletion of the vowel that used to carry it, the same way these
processes are described in the phonological literature. Syllable structure is
computed too, not annotated by hand: a sonority scale and (optionally)
onset/coda constraints decide where the boundaries fall, and rules can refer
to them directly.

When the lexicon records the forms a word is *meant* to reach — its attested
final reflex, and optionally its form at intermediate historical stages — Fortis
grades its own output against them: a phone-level and a finer feature-weighted
edit distance, per stage and for the final surface, so a rule set's accuracy can
be tracked as it is built.

Fortis makes no distinction between "historical sound change" and
"synchronic phonology" — both are an ordered set of rules applied over
time; whether that time span is three millennia or a single derivation is
determined entirely by what you put in `rules.toml`. The repository
includes three example projects: a **feature showcase** (one rule per
mechanism), **Proto-Indo-European → Proto-Germanic**, and **Latin → Modern
French**.

## Design philosophy

- Every inventory — the feature vocabulary and its geometry, the IPA letters,
  the diacritics, the sonority scale, the syllable structure, the
  autosegmental tiers, the lexicon, and the rules — is user-authored data
  loaded at run time; none of it is hardcoded. The engine itself only
  implements the general mechanisms (feature bundles, structural rule
  matching, autosegmental association, syllabification) that such a system
  needs, not a specific language or phonological theory.

- `projects/default` (the shipped feature showcase) is treated as an
  ordinary project rather than a special case, which is why it lives under
  `projects/` instead of at the repo root. A project supplies only the
  files that differ from the default; whatever it omits falls back, so the
  same mechanism that runs the shipped showcase runs a project that
  overrides one file or a project that overrides all of them. That default
  project does ship with its own feature system, letter inventory,
  diacritics, sonority scale, and syllable structure, described in detail
  in [`docs/default_system.md`](docs/default_system.md) — a starting point
  to build from or override, not a fixed part of the engine.

- The codebase is organized as a one-way dependency DAG — `models` (inert
  data) ← `parsing` ← `loaders` ← `application` (the engine) — and each
  layer may only import from those before it. That constraint is enforced
  by what's importable, not just documented (see [Layout](#layout)).

- Rule notation is validated at load time, and every problem in a file is
  collected and reported together rather than stopping at the first one
  found. An unsyllabifiable cluster or an ambiguous rule interaction (§6.3
  of the user guide) is surfaced as an error rather than resolved silently.

- Autosegmental tiers, onset/coda constraints, and a custom sonority scale
  are all optional. Without a `tiers.toml`, the tier machinery doesn't run
  at all, so a project with no tone or stress carries no runtime cost from
  the mechanism that would support them.

## Using it

### Command line

Run the derivations — the shipped default is a **feature showcase**, one word-scoped rule per
feature (voicing assimilation, i-umlaut, devoicing, deletion, epenthesis, degemination, tone spread):

```
python -m src.fortis.main
```

Or point it at your own data. `--words FILE` and `--rules FILE` override just the lexicon and
the sound changes (the feature system, letters, sonority, tiers, etc. stay the shipped
defaults); `--project DIR` runs a **project** — a directory whose own files override the
defaults, with any it omits falling back to them, so a project holds only what differs:

```
python -m src.fortis.main --words my_words.toml --rules my_rules.toml
python -m src.fortis.main --project projects/pie_to_germanic   # PIE → Proto-Germanic
```

The lexicon, the rule list, the diacritics, and the sonority scale may each be written as
**TOML or CSV** — the loader dispatches on the file extension, so `--words my_words.csv` or a
project carrying `rules.csv` works the same way (the CSV is a flatter, spreadsheet-friendly form
of the same schema; if a project has both formats of a file, TOML wins). The feature system,
tiers, and syllable parameters stay TOML, since they nest. See `docs/user_guide.md` §4.1–§4.2.

Every run also writes reports alongside the printed trace: `output.md` (the
firing-rule trace per word) and `derivation_table.csv` (one row per word and one
column per rule — each titled `<time>: <rule>` — holding the word's resulting
form wherever that rule fired, empty otherwise). If the lexicon carries attested
forms (`final` and/or intermediate `stages`), four more reports analyse the
result: `distances.md` grades it (phone and feature edit distance, per stage and
final); `diagnosis.md` shows which phones are confused and in what environment;
`timeline.md` shows when in the cascade errors enter and re-runs the diagnosis at
each attested stage; and `blame.md` attributes each wrong word to the rule that
produced it (see [Diagnosing a rule set](#diagnosing-a-rule-set)). A
run ends with a one-line summary on stderr — words derived, rules applied,
per-phase timing, files saved — and shows a progress bar while deriving in a
terminal. All reports land in the `<project>/` directory; `--output` overrides
the Markdown path (the others follow into the same directory):

```
python -m src.fortis.main --project projects/latin_to_french --output
```

Deriving one word never touches another, so a large lexicon is fanned across worker
processes **automatically** — a ~4–6× speedup on a multi-core machine, with output
byte-identical to a serial run. Small lexica stay in a single process (the pool's
startup cost is not worth paying below a couple hundred words). Pass `--serial` to
force one process, or `--workers N` to pin the pool size. The same flags apply to the
grading/diagnosis CLI (`python -m src.fortis.analysis.main`), which derives the same way.

### Web app

`web/` is a browser front end that runs the same Python engine used by the CLI —
compiled to WebAssembly and executed in-browser via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org),
rather than a separate JavaScript reimplementation. Edit any of the 9 project
files (the eight inventories plus `settings.toml`, or load your own project) and
the derivations re-run in a trace view, with **Grading**, **Diagnosis**,
**Timeline**, and **Blame** tabs that score and analyse them against the lexicon's
attested forms when it has them; see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for the full
picture, including the type scale and theming. To run it locally:

```
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Grading against attested forms

A lexicon entry may record the form the engine should reproduce — its `final`
reflex, and optionally its form at intermediate historical `stages` keyed by rule
time. Both the table form (with targets) and the bare `word = "gloss"` form
(ungraded) are accepted:

```toml
"ˈɑmɑt" = {gloss = "aime", final = "ɛm", 600 = "ˈãj̃məθ", 1400 = "ɛm"}
"tag"   = "final devoicing"
```

Each derived form is compared to its target with two edit distances: a **phone**
distance (a base segment plus its combining marks is one phone; an exact match is
0) and a finer **feature** distance (a substitution costs the number of features
that differ, so `ɑ̃` is one edit from `ɑ` but eleven from `t`; an adjacent-swap
metathesis counts as one). Both are reported per word and in aggregate, per stage
and for the final surface, in `distances.md`. To grade without a full run:

```
python -m src.fortis.analysis.main --project projects/latin_to_french
```

Intermediate `stages` are graded by matching the derived snapshot at rule-time T
against the attested form at stage T, so those rows are only meaningful when the
rule times are calibrated to the stage timescale — the `final` score never
depends on that alignment.

### Diagnosing a rule set

Grading says _how_ wrong a derivation is; three further analyses say _what_ and
_where_, all from the same attested targets and written on every run when the
lexicon has them:

- **`diagnosis.md`** — a ranked tally of the phone confusions across the lexicon
  (which target phone came out as which), and a **context autopsy** that, for the
  phones most often wrong, finds the attested-form environments most associated
  with the error (by phi coefficient).
- **`timeline.md`** — _when_ errors enter: each wrong phone attributed to the
  rule-time that produced it (via the blame provenance below), plus the full
  diagnosis re-run at each attested stage.
- **`blame.md`** — each wrong word attributed to the specific rule that produced
  the wrong phone, tracing (by stable segment id) which rule last set it, with a
  per-step trajectory toward each era's attested form.

To preview a change before committing it, `--try 'RULE'` splices a candidate rule
into the cascade (optionally at `--at TIME`), re-derives, and writes `whatif.md` —
how many words it improves, regresses, or leaves unchanged:

```
python -m src.fortis.analysis.main --project projects/latin_to_french --try 'eː → ɛː / _ t'
```

To focus the error analyses on an environment, `--scope 'PATTERN'` writes a
`scoped_output.md` — the four analyses above (grading, diagnosis, timeline, blame)
recomputed over just the words whose attested target, or **any** attested stage, matches
the pattern — leaving the whole-lexicon reports intact. So you can debug accuracy on a
sub-population, including words that carried an /s/ at some stage even if it later dropped:

```
python -m src.fortis.analysis.main --project projects/latin_to_french --scope 'ʁ'
```

To trace a configuration through the derivation, `--filter 'PATTERN'` on the engine
run synthesises every word the pattern touches in **any** form — its input, an
intermediate derived form, the surface, the attested target, or a stage — into
`filtered_output.md` (each matched word's trace, labelled by where it matched, over a
subset grading + confusion header) and `filtered_table.csv`. Because a pattern is often
transient (it arises at one rule and resolves at a later one), most matched words derive
correctly: this answers *which* words pass through a shape and *where*, not which are
wrong. The pattern is the same notation a rule target uses (feature bundles, letters,
quantifiers):

```
python -m src.fortis.main --project projects/latin_to_french --filter 'd͡ʒ'
```

The thresholds these analyses use (the autopsy's support floor, how many phones
to autopsy, the edit distance's metathesis cost) are tunable per project in an
optional `settings.toml`; a project that omits it, or any key, gets the built-in
defaults.

## How it works

### Rule matching

The central problem the engine solves is deciding _where_ a rule applies in a
word. This lives in `application/matching.py`; `find_matches(rule, segments)` returns one
`Match(start, end, bindings)` for every place the rule fires.

#### What a rule looks like, and what a "match" is

A parsed rule (`StructuralDescription`) is `A → B / C _ D // E _ F`:

- **target** `A` — the span that gets rewritten (`segments[start:end]`),
- **result** `B` — what it becomes (used by the _applier_, not during matching),
- **left / right context** `C` / `D` — what must sit immediately before / after the target,
- **left / right exception** `E` / `F` — an environment in which the rule must _not_ fire.

Each part is a sequence of **elements** (`models/elements.py`): a feature bundle
`[+syll]`, a letter, a disjunction `(X|Y)`, a quantified element `X{2}` / `X*`, a
group `(X Y)`, a word/syllable boundary `#` / `$`, a binding `1=X`, a recall `@1`,
a negation `!X`, the wildcard `[]`, or the null segment `∅`. The full notation
reference lives in [`docs/user_guide.md`](docs/user_guide.md) §5.

A **locus** (a match) is a target span where the left context matches _immediately
to its left_, the right context _immediately to its right_, and the exception
environment does _not_ hold around it.

#### Three layers

**1. The leaf — does one pattern match one segment?** `pattern_matches(pattern,
segment)` walks the pattern's features. Each feature the pattern names must be
present in the segment with a compatible value; a feature it doesn't name is
unconstrained. The corner cases: `[F: none]` matches an _absent_ feature, `[F:
!val]` matches absence too, a bare concrete value fails against absence. A
**syllable-tier** feature (tone, stress) is tested against the segment's syllable
nucleus rather than the segment. A **conditional** feature `[<n: F>]` never
filters — it records whether its condition held, for the applier to gate the
paired result feature. **Alpha** features (`αF`) resolve against the bindings.

**2. The sequence matcher — does a run of elements match here?** `_match_element`
takes one element and is a _generator_: it yields every `(end_position, bindings)`
that element could produce, because one element can match in several ways.
`_match_sequence` chains them — match the first element, then from each resulting
position recurse on the rest. So matching is a **backtracking search**: a `[-syll]*`
may consume 0, 1, 2… segments and every alternative is explored until the whole
sequence fits. The element cases:

- a bundle / letter / `[]` consumes one segment if it matches;
- `(X|Y)` tries each branch (recording which one matched, so the applier can pick
  the paired result branch);
- `X{m,n}` is **greedy** — `_match_repeat` tries the most repetitions first;
- `(X Y)` splices its sub-sequence inline;
- `#` / `$` are **zero-width assertions** — they consume nothing and just check the
  position is a word edge / syllable boundary;
- `1=X` binds reference _1_ to the whole span `X` matched; `@1` replays it (the
  captured segments must re-match here, exactly);
- `!X` matches one segment that `X` does _not_ match;
- `∅` is a zero-width insertion point.

**3. The locus search — `find_matches`, in two passes.** Two passes are needed
because some bindings must be discovered before others can be checked:

- **Pass 1 — fix the span.** For each start position, match the **target alone**,
  _alpha-blind_ (alpha matches everything and binds nothing). This pins the
  candidate target spans and captures the target's reference bindings without
  committing alpha. The greediest fully-valid parse at each start wins.
- **Pass 2 — `_locate`, check the environment.** For a candidate `(start, end)`
  span: pre-seed the **right context's** references (so a recall to their left can
  resolve — references are scope-based, not left-to-right), then evaluate left
  context (matched _ending at_ `start`) → target (re-matched over exactly `[start,
end)`) → right context (matched _starting at_ `end`) → the deferred-`!α` check →
  the exception. If all hold, return the `Match`.

The contexts float against the target: the left context's right edge is anchored
at `start` while its left edge slides (`_match_ending_at`), the right context's
left edge is anchored at `end` (`_match_starting_at`). The exception uses the same
two anchored matches — if an exception-left _and_ an exception-right both match, the
locus is **blocked**.

#### The bindings environment

A `Bindings` (`models/bindings.py`) is threaded through the whole search:

- **references** (`n=` / `@n`) — _scope-based_: the target's bindings (pass 1) and
  the right context's (pre-seeded in pass 2) are captured first, so a recall
  resolves wherever it sits. A binding captures its whole matched span (one segment,
  or several for a group `1=([X][Y])`); a recall replays it segment-for-segment.
- **alpha** (`α`, `β`) — _order-independent value agreement_: each occurrence's op
  (`α` same, `-α` opposite, `!α` other) states how its position relates to `α`, and
  the rule fires under any consistent assignment.
- **conditions** — per-label truth of conditional features, AND-accumulated.
- plus the disjunction branch taken and any deferred `!α` constraints.

#### A worked example

Rule `[+syll] → [+nasal] / [+nasal] _` ("a vowel nasalises after a nasal"), word
`ana` = `[a, n, a]`:

1. Pass 1 scans start positions. The target `[+syll]` matches `a` at 0 → span
   `[0,1)`, and `a` at 2 → span `[2,3)`.
2. `_locate` on `[0,1)`: the left context `[+nasal]` must match _ending at_ 0 —
   there is nothing before position 0 → no match → rejected.
3. `_locate` on `[2,3)`: the left context `[+nasal]` ending at 2 is segment 1, `n`
   — a nasal → matches; the right context is empty; no exception → **locus at
   `[2,3)`**.

So `find_matches` returns one match, on the final `a`. The applier then rewrites
just that span; `deriving.py` splices the result back and moves to the next rule.

### Autosegmental tiers

A feature declared on a tier (`projects/default/tiers.toml`) — e.g. `tone` or `stress` — lives
not in the segment's feature bundle but as an **autosegment** on a separate tier, linked to
its anchor segment by identity. That identity link is what makes classic autosegmental
behaviour fall out:

- **Stability** — the link is to a segment _id_, so when a rule deletes that segment the
  autosegment survives as _floating_; a **melody** tier (`melody = true`, e.g. tone) carries
  it onto the surviving neighbour and re-docks it, so a tone outlives its vowel. A **metrical**
  tier (`melody = false`, e.g. stress) stays put.
- **Spread / dock / delink** — rules link one autosegment to many anchors (`~n`), dock a
  floating autosegment (`⟨…⟩`) onto an anchor, or remove an association (`tone: none`). See
  `docs/user_guide.md` §5.12.
- **Optional** — with no `tiers.toml` the tier machinery never runs; the engine behaves
  exactly as before, so a project that doesn't need tones pays nothing.

Internally a word is a `Form` (`models/form.py`): a list of `Segment`s (a feature bundle plus
a stable id) alongside the tiers. The matcher and renderer read suprasegmentals back through a
transient "lowered" view, so they keep working on plain bundles; `application/tiers.py` holds
the tier operations (associate at construction, prune/OCP cleanup, redock, and the
spread/dock/delink writes).

### Syllabification

Syllable boundaries are computed, not annotated — run on the input and refreshed before every
rule that uses the `$` assertion, so `$` always reflects the current structure. Nuclei are
identified from `syllable_parts.toml`; between each adjacent pair, the intervening consonants
default to a sonority-driven Maximal Onset division, or — if `syllable_parts.toml` defines
onset/coda patterns — the longest pattern-legal split wins instead, which can license clusters
sonority alone wouldn't (e.g. _s_+stop onsets). See §7 of
[`docs/user_guide.md`](docs/user_guide.md) for the full account.

## Layout

A strict downward dependency DAG — each layer imports only from those above it
(`models` ← `parsing` ← `loaders` ← `application`); `models` is inert data.

## Current limitations and future directions

- **Deterministic only.** A rule either fires everywhere its structural
  description matches, or is restricted to specific words via `words`;
  there's no notion of a rule applying only some of the time (sporadic or
  gradient change beyond that word-level restriction).
- **No morphological structure.** The lexicon is a flat list of IPA/gloss
  pairs — there's no morpheme boundary, affixation, or reduplication, so a
  process conditioned on morphological structure (or a reduplicative copy)
  isn't expressible.
- **Some rule interactions are undefined by design.** Two rules sharing
  both a `time` and an adjacent file position, with overlapping loci, have
  an undefined interaction (§6.3 of the user guide); the rule author is
  responsible for distinct `time` values or an explicit order where it
  matters.
- **Round-trip identity isn't guaranteed.** Only round-trip _stability_ is
  (parsing and re-rendering a form twice yields the same string both
  times) — an inventory's letters and diacritics may not spell a derived
  form back exactly as it was first typed.
- **No cross-project or typological validation.** Nothing checks a
  project's feature system against an external phonological inventory
  database, or against another project's; consistency across projects is
  the author's responsibility.
- **Rule-based, not constraint-based.** Fortis models sound change as
  ordered rewrite rules (SPE/autosegmental style); there's no
  Optimality-Theoretic ranking or violation-tableau mode.
- **The browser engine is slow relative to the CLI.** Pyodide runs real
  CPython compiled to WASM, which is meaningfully slower than native
  CPython — deriving a few dozen words can take tens of seconds in the
  browser versus a fraction of a second from the command line.
- **The web app has no persistence layer.** A loaded project lives only in
  that browser tab's memory; there's no save-to-cloud, sharing, or
  multi-user collaboration, only per-file download.

None of these are commitments, but plausible directions if the project
grows: richer (weighted or optional) rule application for gradient change,
some notion of morphological structure to support reduplication and
affix-conditioned rules, metrical foot structure alongside the existing
tone/stress tiers, further grading work (frequency-weighted accuracy, and
attribution of errors to morphological analogy rather than sound change — the
segmental confusion diagnosis, per-stage divergence, and rule-level blame under
[Diagnosing a rule set](#diagnosing-a-rule-set) are already in place), and
performance work on the browser build if it becomes more than a demo/playground.
