# Fortis

A diachronic phonology engine. Everything is user-supplied in `inventories/`
(feature system, letters, diacritics, sonority scale, syllable parameters,
lexicon, sound-change rules); the engine segments each word into feature
bundles, runs it through the rules in chronological order, and prints a
step-by-step derivation with syllable structure. The reference data models the
development from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic.

Run the derivations:

```
python -m src.fortis.main
```

## How rule matching works

The heart of the engine is deciding _where_ a rule applies in a word. This lives
in `application/matching.py`; `find_matches(rule, segments)` returns one
`Match(start, end, bindings)` for every place the rule fires.

### What a rule looks like, and what a "match" is

A parsed rule (`StructuralDescription`) is `A → B / C _ D // E _ F`:

- **target** `A` — the span that gets rewritten (`segments[start:end]`),
- **result** `B` — what it becomes (used by the _applier_, not during matching),
- **left / right context** `C` / `D` — what must sit immediately before / after the target,
- **left / right exception** `E` / `F` — an environment in which the rule must _not_ fire.

Each part is a sequence of **elements** (`models/elements.py`): a feature bundle
`[+syll]`, a letter, a disjunction `(X|Y)`, a quantified element `X{2}` / `X*`, a
group `(X Y)`, a word/syllable boundary `#` / `$`, a binding `1=X`, a recall `@1`,
a negation `!X`, the wildcard `[]`, or the null segment `∅`.

A **locus** (a match) is a target span where the left context matches _immediately
to its left_, the right context _immediately to its right_, and the exception
environment does _not_ hold around it.

### Three layers

**1. The leaf — does one pattern match one segment?** `pattern_matches(pattern,
segment)` walks the pattern's features. Each feature the pattern names must be
present in the segment with a compatible value; a feature it doesn't name is
unconstrained. The corner cases: `[F: none]` matches an _absent_ feature, `[F:
!val]` matches absence too, a bare concrete value fails against absence. A
**syllable-tier** feature (tone, stress) is tested against the segment's syllable
nucleus rather than the segment. A **conditional** feature `[<n: F>]` never
filters — it records whether its condition held, for the applier to gate the
paired result feature. **Alpha** features (`αF`) resolve against the bindings.

**2. The sequence matcher — does a run of elements match here?** `_match_element`
takes one element and is a _generator_: it yields every `(end_position, bindings)`
that element could produce, because one element can match in several ways.
`_match_sequence` chains them — match the first element, then from each resulting
position recurse on the rest. So matching is a **backtracking search**: a `[-syll]*`
may consume 0, 1, 2… segments and every alternative is explored until the whole
sequence fits. The element cases:

- a bundle / letter / `[]` consumes one segment if it matches;
- `(X|Y)` tries each branch (recording which one matched, so the applier can pick
  the paired result branch);
- `X{m,n}` is **greedy** — `_match_repeat` tries the most repetitions first;
- `(X Y)` splices its sub-sequence inline;
- `#` / `$` are **zero-width assertions** — they consume nothing and just check the
  position is a word edge / syllable boundary;
- `1=X` binds reference _1_ to the whole span `X` matched; `@1` replays it (the
  captured segments must re-match here, exactly);
- `!X` matches one segment that `X` does _not_ match;
- `∅` is a zero-width insertion point.

**3. The locus search — `find_matches`, in two passes.** Two passes are needed
because some bindings must be discovered before others can be checked:

- **Pass 1 — fix the span.** For each start position, match the **target alone**,
  _alpha-blind_ (alpha matches everything and binds nothing). This pins the
  candidate target spans and captures the target's reference bindings without
  committing alpha. The greediest fully-valid parse at each start wins.
- **Pass 2 — `_locate`, check the environment.** For a candidate `(start, end)`
  span: pre-seed the **right context's** references (so a recall to their left can
  resolve — references are scope-based, not left-to-right), then evaluate left
  context (matched _ending at_ `start`) → target (re-matched over exactly `[start,
end)`) → right context (matched _starting at_ `end`) → the deferred-`!α` check →
  the exception. If all hold, return the `Match`.

The contexts float against the target: the left context's right edge is anchored
at `start` while its left edge slides (`_match_ending_at`), the right context's
left edge is anchored at `end` (`_match_starting_at`). The exception uses the same
two anchored matches — if an exception-left _and_ an exception-right both match, the
locus is **blocked**.

### The bindings environment

A `Bindings` (`models/bindings.py`) is threaded through the whole search:

- **references** (`n=` / `@n`) — _scope-based_: the target's bindings (pass 1) and
  the right context's (pre-seeded in pass 2) are captured first, so a recall
  resolves wherever it sits. A binding captures its whole matched span (one segment,
  or several for a group `1=([X][Y])`); a recall replays it segment-for-segment.
- **alpha** (`α`, `β`) — _order-independent value agreement_: each occurrence's op
  (`α` same, `-α` opposite, `!α` other) states how its position relates to `α`, and
  the rule fires under any consistent assignment.
- **conditions** — per-label truth of conditional features, AND-accumulated.
- plus the disjunction branch taken and any deferred `!α` constraints.

### A worked example

Rule `[+syll] → [+nasal] / [+nasal] _` ("a vowel nasalises after a nasal"), word
`ana` = `[a, n, a]`:

1. Pass 1 scans start positions. The target `[+syll]` matches `a` at 0 → span
   `[0,1)`, and `a` at 2 → span `[2,3)`.
2. `_locate` on `[0,1)`: the left context `[+nasal]` must match _ending at_ 0 —
   there is nothing before position 0 → no match → rejected.
3. `_locate` on `[2,3)`: the left context `[+nasal]` ending at 2 is segment 1, `n`
   — a nasal → matches; the right context is empty; no exception → **locus at
   `[2,3)`**.

So `find_matches` returns one match, on the final `a`. The applier then rewrites
just that span; `deriving.py` splices the result back and moves to the next rule.

## Layout

A strict downward dependency DAG — each layer imports only from those above it
(`models` ← `parsing` ← `loaders` ← `application`); `models` is inert data.
