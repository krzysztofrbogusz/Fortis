"""Autosegmental tier diagrams as monospace Unicode text.

The classic autosegmental picture, in text: autosegments sit on tier rows above the
segments, joined to their anchors by association lines. One autosegment forking to
several anchors is **spread**; several converging on one anchor is a **contour**; an
unlinked autosegment **floats** at its lexical position with no line. Rendered with
box-drawing characters so it stays readable in any monospace IPA font.
