"""Autosegmental diagrams as monospace Unicode text — one canonical rule picture per change.

A **suprasegmental** change (tone, stress) is Goldsmith's tonal notation: syllables in a row (the
tone-bearing units) over their tones on a tier **below**, joined by association lines — a tone
forking to several syllables is a **spread**, several tones stacked under one a **contour**. A
**segmental** node spread (place assimilation, vowel harmony) is the Halle-Vaux-Wolfe feature
geometry: the target's and trigger's trees side by side, segments on top, with a dashed arrow
spreading the recalled node. Both style associations the same way — ``│`` kept · ``┊`` added
(dashed) · ``╪`` / ``⧧`` delinked — and draw the rule as a single picture. Box-drawing characters
keep it readable in any monospace IPA font.
