"""Pattern matching against realized material.

Two layers:

* ``pattern_matches`` — the leaf: does one pattern bundle match one realized
  segment? Alpha variables resolve limb by limb against a threaded ``Bindings``
  environment (first occurrence binds, later ones compare per the alpha op).
* ``find_matches`` — the sequence matcher: a backtracking walk over the rule's
  Element AST that finds every locus where the target matches and the contexts
  hold (and the exception environment does not). It builds on ``pattern_matches``
  for each single segment.

The two binding namespaces have *different* ordering rules (per the notation
spec), so the matcher runs in two passes per candidate locus:

* **References** (``n=`` / ``@n``) are scope-based, not order-based: "the target
  is ref-bound first at match time" (§2.3.1). Pass 1 matches the target alone to
  discover its span and capture its reference bindings; these are then available
  everywhere in pass 2 regardless of position.
* **Alpha** variables are order-based — first occurrence binds, evaluated
  left context → target → right context (§5.6 / §2.4). Pass 2 re-evaluates the
  whole environment in that order (seeded with pass 1's references), so the
  target's alpha resolves against an already-bound left context.

The ``$`` syllable boundary is a zero-width assertion checked against a set of
boundary positions threaded in alongside ``letters`` (empty when the form is
unsyllabified, so ``$`` then simply never matches); the positions come from
``application.syllabifying``.

Deferred for v1 (each is an explicit no-match or error, never a silent pass):
multi-segment reference bindings (only single-segment ``n=`` is captured),
contour positional windowing (inherited from ``pattern_matches``), and references
*bound* in a context/exception and recalled in an earlier position — only target
bindings are order-independent; context bindings follow the left → target → right
order.

Negated alpha is fully supported at both layers, since pass 1 is alpha-blind and
defers either to pass 2: a negated *element* wrapping an alpha bundle (``![αF]``)
and a negated alpha *spec* (constructible as ``!-α``, i.e. "not opposite") both
resolve correctly. (``!α`` is the alpha-*other* value marker, not a negation.)
