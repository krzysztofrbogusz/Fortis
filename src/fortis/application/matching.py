"""Pattern matching against realized material.

Two layers:

* ``pattern_matches`` — the leaf: does one pattern bundle match one realized
  segment? Alpha variables resolve limb by limb against a threaded ``Bindings``
  environment — a value-agreement variable: each occurrence's op (same / opposite
  / other) states how its position relates to α, and any consistent assignment
  satisfies it (binding honours the op, so it is order-independent).
* ``find_matches`` — the sequence matcher: a backtracking walk over the rule's
  Element AST that finds every locus where the target matches and the contexts
  hold (and the exception environment does not). It builds on ``pattern_matches``
  for each single segment.

The matcher runs in two passes per candidate locus:

* **References** (``n=`` / ``@n``) are scope-based, not order-based: "the target
  is ref-bound first at match time" (§2.3.1). Pass 1 matches the target alone to
  discover its span and capture its reference bindings; these are then available
  everywhere in pass 2 regardless of position.
* **Alpha** variables are order-*independent* value-agreement variables (SPE):
  binding honours the op (``same`` binds α to the atom, ``opposite`` to its
  opposite), so a ``-α`` position imposes disagreement whether it is reached
  before or after its partner. Pass 1 is alpha-blind (it only fixes the span);
  pass 2 walks left context → target → right context binding/checking alpha, but
  the *result* no longer depends on that walk order. ``!α`` (other) is a ≠
  relation that cannot bind, so it is deferred and verified once α is bound.

The ``$`` syllable boundary is a zero-width assertion checked against a set of
boundary positions threaded in alongside ``letters`` (empty when the form is
unsyllabified, so ``$`` then simply never matches); the positions come from
``application.syllabifying``.

Contour matching honours the positional modifier (``@initial``/``@final``/
``@any``/``@all``/``@n``/``@n;m``): see ``_value_at_position``. The one refused
case is alpha inside a multi-limb ``@any`` (a sub-sequence search that would leak
a binding across failed window attempts).

A reference binding captures its whole matched span — one segment for ``1=[X]``,
several for a group ``1=([X][Y])`` — and a recall ``@n`` replays that span.

A reference may be recalled earlier than it is bound: the target's own bindings are
captured in pass 1; the right context's (and the right exception's) are pre-captured
before they are matched; and a target that recalls a *context* binding — which pass
1 cannot span on its own — has its span found by enumerating the end, letting the
right-context pre-seed resolve the recall (its length then fixes the span). The
remaining deferral (an explicit no-match, never a silent pass) is a target that
recalls a binding bound *later within the target itself*; write the binding before
the recall to avoid it.

Negated alpha is fully supported at both layers, since pass 1 is alpha-blind and
defers either to pass 2: a negated *element* wrapping an alpha bundle (``![αF]``)
and a negated alpha *spec* (constructible as ``!-α``, i.e. "not opposite") both
resolve correctly. (``!α`` is the alpha-*other* value marker, not a negation.)
