"""Derivation driver: sweep a word through every rule, recording what fired.

``apply_rule`` applies one rule to a form (``list[FeatureBundle]``) according to
its application mode; ``derive`` runs the whole rule set in chronological order
and returns the per-word ``Derivation`` trace.

The mode *is* the sweep — a rule is applied in exactly one pass, never iterated
to a fixpoint (§6.2):

* **simultaneous** — every locus is found against the original form, then all
  rewrites are spliced at once; no application sees another's output. Overlapping
  loci within the rule are resolved leftmost-longest non-overlapping (the matcher
  already yields one longest match per start, ascending; §6.3's "undefined
  interaction" governs overlapping *rules*, not loci within one rule).
* **left_to_right** — scan rewriting in place, each output immediately visible;
  the cursor advances past the rewritten *output* (Kaplan & Kay obligatory
  rewrite), so a changed segment can feed a later locus.
* **right_to_left** — the mirror image.

Directional passes terminate for deletion (the form shrinks) and feature change
(the cursor strictly advances past the output). The one shape that would not is a
self-feeding rightward epenthesis (e.g. ``∅ -> x / x _`` under left_to_right),
which inserts past its own advancing cursor without bound; such rules are outside
the realistic diachronic rule set and carry no iteration cap.

The form is threaded through every rule whether or not it fires; only rules that
change the form contribute a ``DerivationStep``. The step's ``change`` summary is
a provisional feature-level diff — IPA rendering is a later milestone — and is
cosmetic: derivation correctness never depends on it.

Syllabification (§7): each rule (re)syllabifies the current form for its match
pass, using the ``SyllablePartsInventory`` constraints in force at the rule's
``time`` — so the input is syllabified before the first rule and the structure is
refreshed after every rule. This is what makes the ``$`` boundary assertion
matchable; with no ``sonorities``/``syllable_parts`` supplied there are no
boundaries and ``$`` simply never matches. (No rule in the current set uses
``$``, so this integration is presently preparatory — it changes no derivation
output, only enables ``$``-conditioned rules.)
