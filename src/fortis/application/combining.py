"""Bundle algebra: combine, compare, and merge realized feature bundles.

Two layers, both pure functions over ``FeatureBundle`` data:

* ``combine`` / ``matches_exactly`` / ``differing`` are **geometry-free** — they
  consult no feature hierarchy, only the bundles themselves.
* ``merge`` is **geometry-aware** — it is ``combine`` followed by a delink pass
  that, for every feature unspecified to ``None``, drops that feature and all of
  its hierarchy descendants (a node going unspecified unspecifies its subtree).
  This is how diacritics and rule results express "delink this node".

(These were once two modules: ``combine`` lived as a method on the
``FeatureBundle`` model, which could not import ``FeatureInventory``, so the
geometry-aware half was split off. Now that both are application-layer functions
that may depend on the vocabulary, they belong together.)
