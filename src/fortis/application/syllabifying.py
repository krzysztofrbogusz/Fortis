"""Syllabification: place syllable boundaries on a form from sonority.

``syllabify`` is a structural pass (not a rule). It identifies nuclei (segments
matching the time-appropriate nucleus definition), then divides the consonants
between each adjacent pair of nuclei into a coda + onset by the **Maximal Onset
Principle** under **sonority sequencing**: the onset is the longest rightmost run
whose sonority strictly rises toward the following nucleus; whatever is left
becomes the preceding nucleus's coda. No segments are inserted or deleted (§7).

The result is the set of boundary positions — a boundary at index ``k`` sits
*before* segment ``k`` (between ``k-1`` and ``k``). A syllabified word also counts
its two word edges (``0`` and ``len``) as syllable boundaries, so the ``$``
assertion holds there as well as at interior divisions; a word with no nucleus is
unsyllabifiable and yields no boundaries at all.

Sonority levels come from the user's scale by first-match in file order
(``SonoritiesInventory`` preserves it); a segment matching no predicate is
treated as least sonorous.

Onset/coda **patterns** from ``syllable_parts`` are element sequences (the same
notation as a rule context) that a candidate constituent must match in full.
When a pattern is defined, it *defines* legality: every split point is a
candidate, the longest pattern-legal onset wins, and sonority is not consulted —
so a pattern may license a non-sonority-rising onset (e.g. ``s``+stop). With no
pattern, the sonority Maximal Onset division above is used. ``[nasal]`` is a
mandatory single-nasal coda; ``[nasal]?`` an optional one (the matcher's
quantifiers express optionality — there is no implicit empty). If no split is
pattern-legal the cluster is unsyllabifiable and ``SyllabificationError`` is
raised rather than emitting an illegal division. Patterns apply only at the
interior split where there is a choice; word-edge onsets/codas are forced and not
checked.
