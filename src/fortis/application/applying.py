"""Result application: rewrite a matched span per a rule's result.

``apply_match`` takes one locus found by the matcher (a ``Match``) and the rule,
and returns the feature bundles that replace the matched span ``[start, end)``.
The driver splices that replacement back into the word and handles application
modes; this module only computes a single locus's rewrite.

Two paths, decided exactly as the parser's validator decides cardinality
(``_is_merge_bundle``, reused verbatim below so the two never diverge):

* **Replacement** — the result is all letters / recalls / ``∅`` (no merge
  bundle). It fully specifies the output, so the whole span collapses into or
  expands to the rendered result, with no per-segment correspondence
  (``au → e``, ``e → au``, deletion, insertion).
* **Merge** — the result contains a feature bundle, which preserves the
  unspecified features of its source segment. Target and result then line up
  one-to-one (equal counts, ``∅`` included). The span is walked with a cursor
  that advances past each consuming target element but not past a ``∅`` (which
  consumes nothing and marks an insertion point).

A merge-path target may be any single-segment element — feature bundle, letter,
wildcard, recall, a negated class (``![+nasal]``), or a single-segment binding
(``1=[X]``) — plus ``∅`` for an insertion point.

Conditional result features (``[<n: F>]``) are applied only when their label's
condition held during matching (recorded in ``bindings.conditions``); otherwise
the feature is skipped.

Complex elements are resolved before the merge/replace logic: a disjunction to its
matched branch, a group to its sub-sequence, a fixed-count quantifier to that many
copies. A **variable** quantifier on the merge path (``X* -> Y*``) takes its
per-locus count from the matched span, so its paired result quantifier repeats the
same number of times. What still raises (rather than misapply silently): *two*
variable-width target elements (the span split is ambiguous), a variable quantifier
whose inner is itself variable-width, and a variable quantifier on the *replacement*
path (no target span to pair against).
