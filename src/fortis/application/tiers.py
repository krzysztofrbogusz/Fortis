"""Autosegmental tier operations over a Form.

Suprasegmental features (tone, stress) live on declared tiers, not in the segment bundles.
``associate_tiers`` builds a tier at construction (lifting the features off the bundles and
stripping them); ``cleanup_tiers`` and ``redock_to_nuclei`` maintain it after each rule —
pruning links to deleted segments (the source of tonal stability), applying the OCP, and
following a shifted nucleus; ``split_carried``/``write_to_tier`` route a rule's
suprasegmental writes onto the tier; ``carried_features``/``lower_tiers`` read them back so
the matcher and renderer keep working on bundles as before.
