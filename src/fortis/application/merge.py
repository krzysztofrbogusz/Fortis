"""Geometry-aware merge: apply a delta bundle to a base, delinking nodes.

When a delta sets a feature to ``None`` (unspecified), that feature and
all its descendants are removed from the result.  This is how diacritics
and rule results express "delink this node" — a value of ``None`` means
"unspecify", not "set to an abstract null".

``combine_with`` on ``FeatureBundle`` remains geometry-free (it cannot
take ``FeatureInventory`` without re-coupling models to the vocabulary).
