"""Candidate rule generation: the proposal lattice (plan §2.2).

For each residual correspondence the proposer emits candidate rules as **notation strings** and
parses each through the existing ``load_rule`` — anything that fails to parse or validate is
silently dropped, so the generator can be aggressive and the parser stays the single source of
truth for what a legal rule is. The v1 language is a deliberate subset of Fortis notation:
literals, single-feature bracketed elements, one- or two-element contexts, and ``#``.

The lattice per correspondence (rewrite the derived phone toward the target):

1. **Unconditioned** — ``got → expected`` (substitutions only; an indel needs a context).
2. **Single predictor** — the top derived-side predictors, each as a left or right context:
   ``got → expected / p _``, ``got → expected / _ [+nasal]``, ``got → expected / _ #``.
3. **Predictor pairs** — a top-left and a top-right predictor together: ``got → expected / L _ R``.

Indels follow the same shape with a required context (plan §2.2 tier 5): a **deletion**
``got → ∅`` (delete a spurious derived phone) needs a context by policy — an unconditioned
deletion is too blunt to price fairly — and an **insertion** ``∅ → expected`` needs one by the
notation itself. Natural-class targets (tier 4) and self-conditioning arrive in M2/M4.

Everything is capped at ``contexts_per_confusion``; ``words = [...]`` restrictions are never
emitted (per-word suppletion is the human's tool, not the search's — plan §1.3).
