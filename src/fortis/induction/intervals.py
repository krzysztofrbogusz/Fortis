"""Stage-aware decomposition: interval bucketing, mini-projects, and the synthetic benchmark.

The attested stage times partition the cascade into intervals ``(input → t₁), (t₁ → t₂), …,
(tₙ → final)``. Per interval the training set is the words attesting **both** endpoints, and
the interval's input is the *attested* earlier form, not a derived one — teacher forcing. This
buys three things (plan §3.1): intervals are fully independent (inducible in parallel, no
upstream contamination), the ordering search shrinks from one global problem to n+1 local
ones, and an attested stage can expose an environment the final form has since erased.

An interval problem is literally a :class:`Project`: the words become ``{source_form:
Word(ipa=source, final=target, frequency=…)}``, the rules start empty, and everything else
(features, letters, tiers, settings, syllabification) is shared with the parent — so every
downstream tool (``derive_all``, ``grade``, ``confusions``, ``blame``) runs on it unchanged.

The synthetic generator (:func:`synthetic_project`) derives the real cascade and snapshots
``form_at_time`` at each attested stage, emitting a machine-generated, perfectly self-consistent
lexicon — the learnability floor of §6.1: on it the hand cascade must score ``fit_bits`` 0.
