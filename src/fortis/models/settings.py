"""Per-project tunable parameters (``settings.toml``).

Everything here is a knob a project may set to tune the *analysis* layer without
touching the engine — grading and error diagnosis. The field defaults on these
dataclasses are the single source of truth: a project that ships no ``settings.toml``
(or omits a key) gets exactly these values, and ``projects/default/settings.toml`` is
just a documented mirror of them (a test pins the two together).
