    """Bindings for different elements.

    ``permissive_alpha`` is a resolution mode, not stored data: when set, alpha
    references match unconditionally and bind nothing. The sequence matcher's
    first pass uses it to find a target's structural span and capture its
    reference bindings without committing alpha (which must bind left-context
    first, in the second pass).

    ``conditions`` records, per conditional-feature label, whether that label's
    condition(s) held — accumulated (AND) across the target and context as the
    matcher evaluates them, then consulted by the applier to gate the paired
    result feature.

    ``disjunction_choices`` records, in encounter order, the branch index taken at
    each disjunction matched so far. The applier reads the *target's* slice of these
    (see ``Match.target_choices``) to select the paired result branch.

    ``pending_other`` holds deferred ``!α`` (alpha-*other*) constraints — ``(var,
    atom)`` pairs that require ``atom != α[var]``. Because ``!α`` is a ≠ relation it
    cannot itself *bind* α, so it is recorded here and verified once matching has
    bound the variable (keeping alpha resolution order-independent).
