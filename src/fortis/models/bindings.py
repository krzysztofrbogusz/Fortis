    ``permissive_alpha`` is a resolution mode, not stored data: when set, alpha

    first pass uses it to find a target's structural span and capture its
    reference bindings without committing alpha (which must bind left-context
    first, in the second pass).

    ``conditions`` records, per conditional-feature label, whether that label's
    condition(s) held — accumulated (AND) across the target and context as the
    matcher evaluates them, then consulted by the applier to gate the paired
    result feature.
