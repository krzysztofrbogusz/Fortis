"""Main entry point for the Fortis phonology engine.

Loads every inventory, then for each word: segments the IPA into feature
bundles, runs it through all rules in time order, and prints a step-by-step
derivation showing only the rules that changed the form, with syllable
structure (``.`` between syllables) on the surface. Every run also writes a
Markdown report (``<project>/output.md`` by default; ``--output`` overrides
the path) and ``derivation_table.csv`` alongside it (one row per word, one
column per rule, holding the word's resulting form wherever that rule fired).
When the lexicon carries attested forms (``final`` and/or intermediate
``stages``), a ``distances.md`` summary grading the derivation against them is
written too.
