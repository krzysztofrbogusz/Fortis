"""Attribute each wrong word to the rule that broke it.

The grader says a word is wrong and by how much; this says *where* in the cascade
it went wrong. Three signals, from most to least trustworthy:

- **Segment-id provenance** (the rule-level culprit). Segments carry stable ids
  through the whole derivation, and blame works on *inventory segments* (one phone per
  segment by construction — an affricate ``d͡ʒ`` is one), so a wrong surface phone maps
  straight to its segment id, and the *last* firing step that changed or introduced that
  id is the rule that set the wrong value. A wrong phone whose segment no rule ever touched
  is an **omission** (it should have changed and nothing did); a target phone with no
  surface segment at all is a **deletion** residual (produced-short, no single rule here).

- **Stage divergence** (ground truth, where the lexicon has it). For a word carrying
  attested ``stages``, the earliest stage whose derived snapshot differs from the
  attested form localizes the first divergence to a period — independent of the
  derivation's own trace. Shown alongside the provenance culprit as corroboration.

- **Distance trajectory** (context only). The rendered form after each firing step and
  its phone distance to the target. Distance to the *final* target is not monotone
  mid-cascade — a rule may correctly move a form further from its eventual shape — so a
  rise is flagged but never used to *name* the culprit; it is there to read the path.

The trajectory's final point is ``derivation.surface`` (after ``derive``'s closing
tier cleanup), not the last step's ``after`` — so its distance equals the grader's.
