"""Find the words a phoneme pattern touches anywhere in their derivation.

DiaSim's Suite scopes its diagnostics by a *filter sequence* — the etyma matching a
phoneme pattern. This is the word-level equivalent, but matched against **every form a
word takes**: its input, each intermediate derived form, the surface, the attested
target, and each attested stage. A word is selected if the pattern (Fortis sequence
notation — feature bundles, letters, quantifiers, boundaries, the same a rule target
uses) matches in *any* of those, and each match records **where** it occurred.

Because the pattern may appear transiently — arising at one rule and resolving at a
later one — a matched word is usually *correctly* derived: the payload is *which* words
pass through the configuration and *where*, not an error analysis. Matching a derived
form uses the lowered segments the engine itself matches rules against; an attested
string is segmented (stress-stripped) and skipped if it will not segment (the word may
still match on another form). A pattern that fails to parse or names an unresolvable
symbol is an error, never a silent empty result.
