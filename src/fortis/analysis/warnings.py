"""Collect and render syllabification-fallback warnings.

When a project defines onset/coda patterns, a cluster the patterns cannot legally
divide falls back to the sonority Maximal Onset split (see
:func:`src.fortis.application.syllabifying.syllabification_fallbacks`) so the form
still syllabifies. That is a silent behaviour change worth surfacing: this module
reconstructs, per derived word, whether its **input** or **surface** form needed the
fallback, and renders a Markdown ``warnings.md`` report plus a one-line summary.

Scope: it inspects the input and surface forms only. A fallback on an intermediate
form used solely for a non-firing rule's matching is not separately reported (the
input/surface pair covers the cases that reach the trace).
