"""Stages 3 & 4 — Locus finding and rewrite, plus the top-level apply_rules.

Stage 3 (locus finding):  For each position in the sequence, match left
context so it lands exactly at the target position, then match the target,
then match the right context.  If the exception generator yields nothing,
the locus is valid.

Stage 4 (rewrite):  From the winning Env and target span, instantiate the
result template and splice into the Sequence.  Phase 1 only supports plain
feature-bundle deltas (combine_with); insertion, deletion, and alpha-variable
resolution are deferred.

The top-level ``apply_rules`` orchestrates the full pipeline: for each rule
(in time order), find all loci, then rewrite simultaneously (one rule
sees the original state for all its matches).
