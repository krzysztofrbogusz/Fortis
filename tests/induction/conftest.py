"""Shared fixtures for the rule-induction tests.

These tests run against a small, fully **synthetic** benchmark project
(``tests/induction/fixtures/synth``) — never the mutable ``projects/`` data — so they stay
deterministic regardless of edits to any real project's lexicon. The fixture is self-consistent:
the hand cascade in its ``rules.toml`` regenerates every attested form with zero residual, and it
uses the same stage-time schema (``-200, -100, 750, 1000, 1200, 1400``) as the Latin benchmark.
The fixture is generated (see the header in its ``words.toml``), not hand-typed.
