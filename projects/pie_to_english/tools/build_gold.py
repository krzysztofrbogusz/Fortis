"""Build words.csv — the PIE→English gold lexicon — from the kaikki Wiktionary extracts.

The lexicon IS committed, but under its own licence: it is Wiktionary-derived and therefore
CC BY-SA 4.0 (share-alike), where the rest of the repo is PolyForm Noncommercial. See SOURCE.md.
Run this to regenerate it; the kaikki extracts it reads are not versioned (see CACHE below).

Stage two of two: `build_chains.py` walks the kaikki extracts into `chains.json`; this filters
and scores those chains into `words.csv`.

Three filters do the real work, and they are about honesty rather than coverage:

* Only rows whose PIE form is the true *preform* of the word are kept. Wiktionary links a
  lexeme to a PIE root-representative or an inflected cell, not necessarily to the ancestor of
  the citation form: it cites 3sg *bʰéreti against the PGmc infinitive *beraną, and no correct
  cascade turns one into the other. Verbs, affixes, bare roots and inflected-cell glosses are
  therefore dropped; nominative-singular nouns, numerals, pronouns and particles are kept.
* Attested IPA is normalised to what the inventory can segment (script ɡ, tie bars, the
  raising/lowering diacritics), and a form that still will not segment is left blank rather
  than guessed at — the engine scores a word at whichever checkpoints it has.
* A checkpoint the source cannot be trusted on is BLANKED, not made to condemn the whole row.
  A word with no modern reflex, or several of them, or an unsegmentable modern IPA, has an
  untrustworthy `final` — and a perfectly good Proto-Germanic form. Dropping it (as this once
  did) threw away more than half the Proto-Germanic gold to protect a column those rows were
  never going to be scored on. Only a row with no target at ANY checkpoint is dropped.

#
# Keyed by the Germanic form, not the modern reflex, for three reasons. Most words in the lexicon
# no longer HAVE a modern reflex — they died before English — and keying by one made every one of
# them structurally impossible to correct. The modern key was also ambiguous: "lay" is the reflex
# of both *lagjaną and *laguz. And it is the Germanic form that carries the evidence, so the key
# now names the thing being read.
#
# Wiktionary's `inh` link records a PIE lemma, which is cited in the e-grade — but the Germanic
# word often continues the ZERO grade of the same root. The linked form is then not the preform,
# and no rule can bridge the two: *ǵéwstus can never yield *kustuz. Rather than let the row
# score as a permanent miss (or, worse, let it make a correct rule look broken — OE
# palatalisation dutifully palatalises the front vowel that *cost* should never have had), the
# input is replaced with the actual preform: the zero grade of the same root.
#
# The accent is not decoration. Verner's Law reads it, so it is set by the attested Germanic
# consonant: *mundiz has a VOICED d (Verner fired ⇒ the accent must follow the root), while
# *kunþiz keeps a voiceless þ (Verner did not fire ⇒ the accent sits on the root).
# The same table also carries STEM-CLASS corrections. Wiktionary cites the PIE lemma in one
# gender/stem class where Germanic continues another: *kʷékʷlos is masculine, but PGmc *hwehwlą
# is NEUTER, and a neuter *-om is what gives the attested nasal ending. That is the same
# wrong-preform problem as the ablaut, one level up in the morphology, and it has the same fix.

    "fadiz": "potís",       # *fadiz — voiced *ð, so the cited barytone *pótis cannot be right
    "funsaz": "pń̥tstos",    # *funsaz — VOICELESS *s: Verner did NOT fire, so the cited oxytone

                            # voiceless (it did not ⇒ stressed before it). Only a medial accent

    "andō": "h₂enh₁téh₂",   # *andō — the *d is a hardened *ð, so Verner fired ⇒ oxytone; feminine
    "algiz": "h₁olḱís",     # *algiz — voiced *ɣ ⇒ oxytone, and the attested *a refutes the cited

    "hwehwlą": "kʷékʷlom",  # *hwehwlą — NEUTER. Keep the accent where the source has it:
                            # written oxytone, Verner voices the second *kʷ and gives **hweɣʷlą.

    "nestą": "nisdóm",      # *nestą — NEUTER, not the masculine *nisdós
    # The WEAK feminines. Their nominative is *-ǭ, with a NASAL vowel, and that nasal is the

    "widuwǭ": "h₁widʰewṓn",  # *widuwǭ — the ENDING only, which is all the nasal evidences. It
                            # still misses by one on the medial vowel (*i for the attested *u).
                            # Writing the zero grade *-uw- in fixes that and breaks the *w

                            # independent supports. The smaller, evidenced claim is the one kept.
    "sternǭ": "h₂sternṓn",  # *sternǭ — the *n is the n-stem suffix the weak ending is built on
    "hrīdrǭ": "kreydʰrṓn",  # *hrīdrǭ — cited as a NEUTER *-om, but the nasal *-ǭ is feminine

    "hagjō": "kagʰyéh₂",    # *hagjō — feminine jō-stem, not a neuter *-om. The *-ō is ORAL, and
                            # that is not a slip for the *-ǭ of *hōrǭ/*abjǭ: those are weak ōn-
                            # stems and the nasal is their nominative. Two declensions, not one.

                            # *kweman it is built on. Not something a preform can fix.
    "gunþiz": "gʷʰń̥tis",    # *gunþiz — same shape as *kunþaz: zero grade *u, voiceless *þ
    "kuruz": "gʷr̥h₂ús",     # *kuruz — the attested *ur is the zero-grade *r̥, and it is a u-stem

    # *gʷʰórmos, which would make it a counterexample to the word-initial *gʷʰ > *b that `gwh_to_w`
    # now implements. It is not one: in the footnote to that very passage Ringe writes "I connect
    # PGmc *warmaz 'warm' with Hitt. warnuzzi, not with Av. garəmō" — i.e. he rejects the
    # labiovelar etymology outright. The source hierarchy (Ringe > Wiktionary) says the rule wins
    # and the datum loses. He gives no PIE form to put here in its place, and inventing one is the
    # thing this table exists not to do, so *warmaz stays a miss ON PURPOSE. Do not "fix" the rule.
    #
    # *hlūdaz has a long *ū that the cited *ḱlutós cannot give, and a laryngeal-final root
    # (*ḱluh₁tós) would supply it exactly. But every cognate has a SHORT u — Greek klutós,
    # Sanskrit śrutá-, Latin inclutus — and Wiktionary says in as many words that "the origin of
    # the long vowel is unclear". Writing the laryngeal in would not be reading the preform off
    # the attested form, the way every entry above does; it would be inventing the one feature
    # needed to make the cascade land. It stays a miss, and so does *hūnaz (*ḱuh₁nós), whose long
    # *ū the corpus flatly contradicts: *suh₁nús gives *sunuz with a SHORT u, same environment.
    # *ansuz stays a miss too — see the note on m_to_n_before_t_d in rules.toml: *amsaz keeps its
    # *ms, so *ansuz's *n cannot be a sound change and we have no independent evidence for its
    # preform. *wapsō keeps a STOP *p that no accent or grade can produce from *wóbʰseh₂.

# Wiktionary and the engine spell the same reconstructed sounds differently. These are
# notational identities, not phonological claims: Wiktionary writes the glides as non-syllabic
# ɪ̯/u̯ and the long mid vowels of Proto-Germanic as ɔː/ɛː, where the engine writes j/w and
# oː/eː. Left unreconciled, every word would miss on spelling and the accuracy figure would
# measure transcription style instead of the rules.
#
# ɔː/ɛː are NOT in the list, though they were once: Proto-Germanic ō really is [ɔː] and Old
# English ō really is [oː], so the difference between the columns is a sound change (the
# raising in `wg_long_mid_raising`), not a spelling convention. Mapping it away would have
# hidden a real rule.
#
# θ/ð → θ̠/ð̠ is the same kind of identity, read the other way: both spell Germanic þ, but the
# engine's is non-dental because it inherits PIE *t's alveolar coding, while Wiktionary's plain
# θ is dental by IPA convention. One phoneme, two spellings.
#
# NOT a rule for ɑ→a, though the gold is full of ɑ: the engine derives both (ˈan.θ̠e.rɑz), so
# folding them together turns correct segments into wrong ones — it cost 8 exact matches when
# tried. Where the two really disagree on the low vowel, that is phonology, not spelling.
#
# Applied to the RECONSTRUCTED columns only. The modern column is left alone, where the same
# symbols are contrastive: RP's ɔː (four) is not oː.
# Corrections to the ATTESTED Proto-Germanic form itself, keyed by the Wiktionary headword.
#
# This is a different and far more dangerous thing than PREFORM_FIXES above, and the line between
# them must not blur. PREFORM_FIXES corrects the *input*, using the attested form as INDEPENDENT
# evidence — that is what keeps it out of circularity. This corrects the *target*: the thing the
# engine is scored against. Edit it to make a word pass and the accuracy figure stops measuring
# anything at all.
#
# It is admissible for exactly one reason: **the 200 column is a RECONSTRUCTION, not an
# attestation.** Wiktionary's Proto-Germanic is one scholar's reconstruction and it can simply be
# wrong; where the standard reference work says so in as many words, the reference work wins.
#
# THE RULES, and they are not negotiable:
#   1. ONLY the 200 (Proto-Germanic) column. The 900/1400/final columns are ATTESTED — real
#      recorded Old English, Middle English and modern forms. They are never touched, whatever
#      they cost us.
#   2. ONLY with an explicit citation from Kroonen or Ringe, quoted in the comment. Never from our
#      own inference, and never because a word would otherwise miss.
#   3. The entry must be defensible with the derivation switched off. If the only argument for it
#      is "the cascade would then land", it does not go in.

    # cites Lloyd, "Is there an a-umlaut of i in Germanic?" — so the lowering of *i is doubtful AT
    # PROTO-GERMANIC. It plainly happens LATER (Old English has nest with an /e/ while fisc keeps
    # its /i/), which is where `pgmc_i_lowering` has been re-dated to. The 900 column, being a real

    # of Wiktionary's *weraz. That makes THREE (*nista-, *fiska-, *wira-), all with /i/ at
    # Proto-Germanic, all with /e/ or /i/ later exactly as Old English attests. The lowering is
    # uniformly post-Proto-Germanic, and *weraz was never counter-evidence to that — it was the
    # same error a second time. (Old English wer, with its /e/, is untouched: it is attested.)
