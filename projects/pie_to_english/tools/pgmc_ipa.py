"""Proto-Germanic romanisation → IPA, in Wiktionary's transcription conventions.

Needed because Wiktionary gives IPA for the *lemma* only (`sounds[]`), while the inflected cells
we want live in `forms[]` as bare romanisation: the 3sg present of *beraną is written `biridi` and
no pronunciation is attached to it. To score a verb at Proto-Germanic we have to transcribe that
cell ourselves.

The output deliberately targets **Wiktionary's** conventions, not the engine's, so that it can be
checked against the 4843 lemma pronunciations that Wiktionary does give (see `_selftest`). The
caller then puts the result through the same `normalise(..., reconstructed=True)` that every other
reconstructed column already goes through, which is what converts it to engine notation. Any other
arrangement would leave the verb targets spelled differently from the noun targets and the miss
would look like phonology.

The allophony is the part that cannot be guessed, and it is read off the attested data:

  b   [b] word-initially, after a nasal, and geminate;  [β] elsewhere   (ab /ˈɑβ/)
  d   [d] word-initially, after a nasal, and geminate;  [ð] elsewhere   (gudą /ˈɣu.ðɑ̃/)
  g   [ɣ] EVERYWHERE except after a nasal and geminate, where it is [ɡ] — including
      word-initially, which is where it differs from b and d (gans /ɣɑns/, not */ɡɑns/)
  f   [ɸ] throughout;  þ [θ];  h [x] throughout, including word-initially (hinder /ˈxin.der/)

So the 3sg of *beraną is *biridi /ˈbi.ri.ði/ — with a fricative, because the *d is intervocalic.
